# Interplanetary Weight Calculator ðŸŒŒ
Calculate Your Weight Across the Cosmos!

Ever wondered how much you would weigh on Mars, Jupiter, or even the Moon? This Interplanetary Weight Calculator lets you calculate your weight on various celestial bodies across the solar system based on gravitational differences.

**Overview**
This application provides an interactive and fun way to discover how gravitational forces affect weight on different planets and moons. Simply enter your Earth weight, select a celestial body, and see how much youâ€™d weigh under its unique gravitational pull!

**Key Features**
- Accurate Calculations: Uses gravitational constants specific to each planet and major moon.
- Simple Interface: Easy-to-use input for fast results.
- Planetary Options: Includes all major planets and selected moons for a comprehensive experience.

**How It Works**
Weight on other planets is calculated using the formula:

WeightPlanet = WeightEarth x ( GravityPlanet/ GravityEarth )

where:

Gravity v- aries based on each celestial body's mass and radius.

**Supported Celestial Bodies**
The application includes popular planets like Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and even Earthâ€™s Moon, providing a complete exploration of weight differences across the solar system.

**Contributing**
We welcome contributions! Feel free to submit a pull request to add more features, optimize calculations, or expand the range of celestial bodies.
